To-do:

* ~~Add code to detect country and choose units (metric or imperial) based upon
  the result~~
* ~~Add units toggle so users can choose which one they want to use, and save this
  in the browser session. Should override country detection function.~~
* ~~Reload the data when units are toggled.~~
* ~~Add additional background images to match current conditions~~
* Make background images mobile friendly
